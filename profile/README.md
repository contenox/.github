Hi there 👋

Welcome to contenox! A platform for agent-based applications, conversational interfaces, and knowledge-grounded automation. 

contenox is focused on creating a robust and scalable ecosystem of services that simplify the development and deployment of applications powered by large language models (LLMs) using the contenox DSL.

contenox projects are designed with a modular, microservices-based architecture in mind to provide developers with the core runtime, LLM provider abstraction, and foundational infrastructure needed to build next-generation AI applications.

A complete overview of the ecosystem and projects is located [here](https://github.com/contenox/contenox).
