Hi there 👋

**Contenox**, was an R&D project to prototype a self-hostable runtime for deterministic, observable, state-machine-based AI workflows.

The venture has been sunset, but the runtime code is kept public for reference.  
If you're exploring AI workflow engines, LLM orchestration layers, or sovereign infrastructure patterns, you may find useful ideas here.

Issues and discussions are archived, but the code may be freely studied or forked.
